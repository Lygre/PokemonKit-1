# PokemonKit
PokemonKit is a Swift framework for all your Pokémon related needs.

It contains all manner of types for Pokémon, such as Pokemon Species, Pokemon instances, Attacks, Abilities, and more. PokemonKit also contains a battle engine, which replicates as much of the Sun and Moon battle engine as is possible.

PokemonKit is the main part of my dissertation project, containing all of the model code for a Pokémon battle simulator. Create a user interface that sends turns to the battle engine, and it will resolve said turns as the Sun and Moon battle engine would, too.

Many thanks to @Eevee for creating the [Veekun Pokémon database](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex) this project uses!
